     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>
        The website that I would like to make is an open-source messaging application akin to
        <a href="https://discordapp.com/">discord</a>. 
        The website will not be as ambitious due to various constraints. However, it will support the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create an account.</li>
        <li>Sign in.</li>
        <li>Sign out.</li>
        <li>Create, edit and close channels.</li>
        <li>Invite and remove members from a channel.</li>
        <li>Send and recieve messages posted to the channel.</li>
        <li>Download a log of all conversations recorded on the server.</li>
        <li>Delete all conversation record upon deletion of a channel.</li>
        <li>Optional Features (Features that will be implememnted if enough time): 
            <ul>
                <li>Send and recieve images.</li>
                <li>Send and recieve hyperlinks.</li>
                <li>Send and recieve private messages.</li>
                <li>Send and recieve friend requests.</li>
                <li>Upload zip files to the server.</li>
                <li>Email verification when creating a new account</li>
                <li>Account Recovery</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
     <p><br>
        The goal of the project is to allow a user to create <em>channels</em> and converse with other members of the channel.
        The emphasis will be placed on using the website for teamwork and work related interactions. The project has several constraints
        that will impact the size of the project. Namely, I also have two heavier projects in 
        Comp 345 and Comp 371. Consequently, I need to ensure that I assign myself a workload that I can 
        manage given this circumstance. It is also important to note that this project is done on individually.
        It is not meant to be used as a gaming social media platform, but a serious privacy and security focused professional tool.
        In otherwords, the purpose of the website is to provide a free and open-source alternative to Facebook's messenger,
        Discord or Twitter for those who want to get work done.

    <h2>Website Layout</h2>
    <p>
    The website is going to use a minimalistic approach to creating the website. Please keep in the mind that the following examples may not be final. 
    The layout and color scheme will be changed to accomodate the choosen design. In the meantime, the examples just
    showcase the desired approaximate layout for each sections. It will have six primary pages shown in the table below:<br>
    </p>
   
    
    <table border="1">
        <caption> Main Website Pages</caption>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Page Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Sign In</td>
            <td>User input their unique credentials to acquire a login token
                and gain access to their channels.
            </td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td> Create Account</td>
            <td> Create an Account page. A page that will prompt the user
                 to register an account.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td> Account Settings </td>
            <td>Contains user profiles and options</td>

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>Dashboard</td>
            <td>The dashboard is the page that shows a list of all the channels 
                available to the user.Furthermore, it shows the messaging board 
                for the currently active channel, if applicable. All settings 
                widgets can be assessed from here.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Sign in</h4>

    <p>Sign in is a fundamental feature that is important for the website to work. 
        As such the user experience should be made clear, simple and quick.
        <strong>Figure 1</strong> shows an example login screen. <br>
    </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/880269/screenshots/2707708/login-ui-ux-design.jpg"
            alt="Example Login In Screen Not Found!" style="width:50%">
            <figcaption>Fig.1 - Example Login Screen .</figcaption>
          </figure> 

    <p>
        The login screen will have four major components: 
        <ul>
            <li>Email field.</li>
            <li>Password field.</li>
            <li>Login button.</li>
            <li>Create Account label.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        As previously mentioned the login screen is used by existing users to gain access to the site. 
    </p>

    <h4> Create Account </h4>

    <p>Any user who wishes to use the website need to have an account. Therefore, it is important to have an
        account creation page. <strong>Figure 2</strong> shows an example of an account creation page with all its key elements.
        <br>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://cdn.freshdesignweb.com/wp-content/uploads/site/Modern-Web-Forms.jpg" 
            alt="Example Account Creation Image not found!" style ="width: 50%;">
            <figcaption>Fig.2 - Example Account Creation Screen </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>In order to create an account we will require a username, email, password and phone number.
        The email address will be used to login while the username will be the name displayed to other users.
