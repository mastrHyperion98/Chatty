     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>
        The website that I would like to make is an open-source messaging application akin to
        <a href="https://discordapp.com/">discord</a>. 
        The website will not be as ambitious due to various constraints. However, it will support the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create an account.</li>
        <li>Sign in.</li>
        <li>Sign out.</li>
        <li>Create, edit and close channels.</li>
        <li>Invite and remove members from a channel.</li>
        <li>Send and recieve messages posted to the channel.</li>
        <li>Download a log of all conversations recorded on the server.</li>
        <li>Delete all conversation record upon deletion of a channel.</li>
        <li>Optional Features: 
            <ul>
                <li>Send and recieve images.</li>
                <li>Send and recieve hyperlinks.</li>
                <li>Send and recieve private messages.</li>
                <li>Send and recieve friend requests.</li>
                <li>Upload zip files to the server.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
     <p><br>
        The goal of the project is to allow a user to create <em>channels</em> and converse with other members of the channel.
        The emphasis will be placed on using the website for teamwork and work related interactions. It is not meant to 
        be used as a gaming social media platform, but a serious privacy and security focused professional tool.
