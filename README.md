## REPO STRUCTURE CURRENTLY UNDER REVISION

# SOEN287_Project

This is a repository that serves as an agglomeration of Concordia's Winter 2020 SOEN 287 Web Development Project.

Introduction
======

The project consists of developing any website/application of our choice as long as it utilizes the following tools/languages:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Python
* Flask


The project may also use a database system. Most likely MySQL or PostgreSQL. 

Repository Structure
======

The project is divided into **three** seperate assignments:
* Project Description -- A1
* Template and Bootstrap -- A2
* Remainder of the project -- A3

Therefore, each assignment will be stored seperately onto the repository where a3 is the final version of the project. 
When necessary sub-folders will be created to differentiate between the front-end and the backend.
