# Chatty!

Chatty was developed as an open source communication website during my Concordia 2020 WInter Semester. The Project had no specific requirements and it was left up to the students to decide what they wanted to do. I decided to make Chatty. The course itself was not very demanding and covered basic topics which I found uninteresting. I wanted a greater challenge. Something more pratical. As such, I came up with the idea of Chatty as a communication website. For the most part the website is complete, but is missing updates on the individual chat channels whenever a new message is uploaded to the server. 

# Instructions

* Download the project folder
* cd into the project folder and type <code>source venv/bin/activate</code> to make the venv project active. 
* Install the required packages by typing <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. This command will automatically install all the packages that python will need to run the project. 
* Next execute the quick_start.sh (the current script only supports UNIX/Linux)  

# Future Plans

I do have the intention of trying to polish up the website at some point in the forseable future. At the moment I am very busy with personal projects and other school assignments that I need to focus on. I only want to make slight changes that would be more beneficial to the "Completeness" of the project and make it easier to distribute/host. 

* Channels chat auto-update when other users post a message. 
* Convert the project to use Docker
* Fix scaling issues at some resolutions
* Remove some of the unwanted UI elements that were enforced during the course guidelines.
